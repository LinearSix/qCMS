# qCMS
## A self-contained, stand alone email generating CMS that uses the querystring rather than a database for storage

* Copy the q.html file onto your local drive and open it in a browser (preferably Chrome).
* Add new sections using the sidebar buttons.
* Edit, delete, duplicate, and transform sections using the controls next to each section.
* "Save" your work periodically by bookmarking the page.
* Click "Preview" to view the result.
* Click "Generate HTML" and copy the resulting HTML code from the pop-up window.
* Save the resulting code as an HTML file.

*Note: Storing/serving the q.html file outside a local drive can succumb to issues caused by URL length limits implemented by various server and security protocols.*
