# qCMS
## A self-contained, stand alone email generating CMS that uses the querystring rather than a database for storage

* Copy the q.html file onto your local drive and open it in a browser (preferably Chrome).
* Add new sections using the sidebar buttons.
* Edit, delete, duplicate, reorder, and change visibility for sections using the controls next to each section.
* Enter data in the pop-up dialog to alter the section's content. HTML is allowed.
* Keep in mind when editing a section's type that data might not match properly. IE: Converting a spacer to a header will require text data to be entered afterward.
* "Save" your work periodically by bookmarking the page.
* Click "Generate HTML" and copy the resulting HTML code from the pop-up window.
* Save the resulting code as an HTML file.
* Click "Reset" to clear all data.

*Note: Storing/serving the q.html file outside a local drive can succumb to issues caused by URL length limits implemented by various server and security protocols.*
